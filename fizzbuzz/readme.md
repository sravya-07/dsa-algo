You need to print numbers from 1-100 but print:
- fizz if the number is divisible by 3
- buzz if the number is divisible by 5
- fizzbuzz if the number is divisible by 3 & 5
- number itself it its not a multiple of 3 and 5

Pitfalls:
- not checking if the number divisible by 15 in the first condition
- using 3 if statements instead of a series of if else if statements

if you dont follow both the above rules, you will print fizzbuzzfizzbuzz for multiples of 15 because if a number is divisible by 15 (3*5) it will be divisible by 3 and 5
